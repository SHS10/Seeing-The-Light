Seeing The Light was an Explore Project where Julio and I were a part of and were tasked with creating a color-blindness simulator. We wrote the code in C++ using the OpenCV image processing library (OpenCV version 3.1.0). A lot of time and effort was afforded in researching and attemting to understand color blindness before and during the coding process. This is a working source. However in order to run this code you will need to install opencv 3.1.0 and it's dependencies onto your C++ environment.
